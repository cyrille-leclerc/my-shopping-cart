## Global settings ##
# instance id's distinguish stats of multiple relays.
# do not run multiple relays with the same instance id.
# supported variables:
#  ${HOST} : hostname
instance = "${HOST}"

## System ##
# this setting can be used to override the default GOMAXPROCS logic
# it is ignored if the GOMAXPROCS environment variable is set
max_procs = 2
pid_file = "carbon-relay-ng.pid"
# directory for spool files
spool_dir = "spool"

## Logging ##
# one of trace debug info warn error fatal panic
# see docs/logging.md for level descriptions
# note: if you used to use "notice", you should now use "info".
log_level = "info"

## Inputs ##
### plaintext Carbon ###
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:2003"
# close inbound plaintext connections if they've been idle for this long ("0s" to disable)
plain_read_timeout = "2m"
### Pickle Carbon ###
pickle_addr = "0.0.0.0:2013"
# close inbound pickle connections if they've been idle for this long ("0s" to disable)
pickle_read_timeout = "2m"

## Validation of inputs ##
# you can also validate that each series has increasing timestamps
validate_order = false

# How long to keep track of invalid metrics seen
# Useful time units are "s", "m", "h"
bad_metrics_max_age = "24h"

# regexp rewriter rule to add a prefix of "prefix." to all series

## Instrumentation ##
[instrumentation]
# in addition to serving internal metrics via expvar, you can send them to graphite/carbon
# IMPORTANT: setting this to "" will disable flushing, and metrics will pile up and lead to OOM
# see https://github.com/grafana/carbon-relay-ng/issues/50
# so for now you MUST send them somewhere. sorry.
# (Also, the interval here must correspond to your setting in storage-schemas.conf if you use Grafana Cloud)
